<br><br>
<span class="content">A WebGL bowling game that uses dynamic physics. Dependencies include: Three.js, Cannon.js, Buzz.js, and Tween.js. All of the art assets were created with Blender and the GIMP. Background music composed by <span class="link" onmouseup="window.open( 'http://www.bensound.com' );">Bensound</span>.</span>

<br><br>
<span class="content">Utilizing the marching cubes algorithm and only the WebGL API, this project renders three types of algebraic surfaces. There are five render modes: perspective/orthographic, wireframe, depth buffer, normal buffer, and position buffer. Using the Phong lighting model, the intensity of the lights can be controlled on screen. An interesting bump-map effect is enabled by pressing [s].</span>

<span class="subsection link" onmouseup="window.open( 'http://www.lettier.com/shortest_path/' );">Shortest Path</span>
<br><br>
<span class="content">Generates a random graph each time you load the page. The graph may or may not be connected. To use, select a starting node (now shown in green), select an ending node (now shown in red), and then click begin. The shortest path will be shown in purple. Hit reset to begin again. For a completely different graph, hit new graph. The edge weights are the euclidean distance between any two nodes. Utilizes Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and pure HTML5 canvas code.</span>

<span class="subsection link" onmouseup="window.open( 'http://www.lettier.com/sierpinski/' );">Sierpinski Pyramids</span>
<br><br>
<span class="content">Using only pure WebGL, this project creates two three dimensional Sierpinski pyramids. The subdivision level can be altered in real time. Per-fragment point lighting, instancing, fog, and a fly-through controllable camera are employed.</span>

<span class="subsection link" onmouseup="window.open( 'http://www.lettier.com/simpl/' );">SimPL</span>
<br><br>
<span class="content">An asymmetric autonomous Pong clone where the paddle is controlled by a feed-forward neural network and the neural network's weights evolve over time via a genetic algorithm. As the generations increase, the paddle learns to play, that is, it learns to follow the ball.</span>
<br><br>
<span class="subsection link" onmouseup="window.open( 'http://www.lettier.com/poing/' );">POiNG</span>
<br><br>
<span class="content">A Pong clone with a twist. Here the the player must defend their side of the screen such that they must not only keep the ball from leaving the left side but they must also keep the ball from leaving the top and bottom side of the screen. The right side of the screen is controlled by an AI player where its paddles are controlled by a neural network whose weights were evolved via a genetic algorithm.</span>
