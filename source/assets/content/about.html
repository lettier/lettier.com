During 2007-2008 I was a Greater DC Cares volunteer. Beyond that, I developed an e-commerce website for a local business in Queens, NY. The site utilized a modified version of osCommerce and provided their customers a way to purchase their in-store products online.

<br><br>
<span class="content">
In 2009 a Captain desperately needed a print server installed at the DiLorenzo TRICARE Health Clinic located in Pentagon. Looking over my inventory, I had a spare printer available so we loaded the spare in the Captain's car and brought it over to the clinic. I worked with the local IT department to open a port where I patched it into the switch, assigned it a static IP address, and configured all of the work stations to use the new printer. Needless to say, the Captain was very pleased and expressed his gratitude to my commanding officer.

<span class="subsection">Looking Ahead</span>
<br><br>
<span class="subsubsection"><i>What value do you think you would add to a potential employer/client's business? How would you be "a resource" or even "a resource-broker" for them, rather than just "a job beggar"?</i></span>
<br><br>
<span class="content">
I would certainly be dedicated to their cause, making their goals my own. With their goals being my own, I could not help but to see them through.
</span>
<br><br>

<br><br>
<span class="content">
I bring to the table an inspiring and infectious attitude that inevitably spreads to all those around. Experience can either be locked up or set free depending on one's attitude toward the task at hand. Simply put, my morale-boosting personality, backed by experience, allows me to standout from my peers.

<br><br>
<span class="content">
My personality certainly fits into team-oriented, project-focused organizations. For every hat I have ever worn, I have always become known as the "go-to guy." Being an easy to work with and a mild-mannered individual, my aim is to become your go-to guy.
